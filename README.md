## Standford University CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

This repository includes my notes and assigments for the lecture " Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition".
I would like to thank to Standford University to reach us this wonderful lecture for free.

This repo has a different structure than the original homework because I would like to take the advantage of py files 
and I don't use Google colab or jupyter file for assigmment 1 and 2 too much , I hope tat you are not confused.
