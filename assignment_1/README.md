# Assignment 1

This package includes solutions for assignment_1.

- [conv_net](assignment_1/conv_net) - How filters work?
    - [numpy_example]()
    - [torch_example]()
    
- [gradient]() - How gradients work?

- [knn]() - Code from scratch
    - knn.py is the  file 
    - knn_model.py is the file which computes the distances

SVM and Softmax packages use the files in [cs231n]()

- [svm]() 
    - Uses LinearSVM module which is written in linear_classifier.py 
    - svm_loss_vectorized function + train function 

- [softmax]()
     - Uses Softmax module which is written in linear_classifier.py 
     - softmax_loss_vectorized function + train function
